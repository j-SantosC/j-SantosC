## 👋 Hey, I'm [Jacobo Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobo-santos-cores-949662219)

I'm a **frontend developer** with an eye for clean, functional design and a mild obsession with shipping pixel-perfect interfaces. I mostly work in **Angular**, but lately I’ve been sneaking around with **React** — don’t tell Angular.

🔨 Currently building things at **Silicon Dali**, where I'm helping craft better web experiences one component at a time.

📍 Based in **Salamanca, Spain**, but I work like the internet has no borders.

🪖 Passionate about frontend architecture and writing code that’s actually nice to come back to.
